This is a simple example how to use LEDs and a button.
No SDK code is used, everything is defined manually.

Three LEDs are used:
  * One is a simple status LED, it's on as soon as the devive powers up
  * The second is controlled from the button via PPI
  * The third is controlled from the button via Irq
